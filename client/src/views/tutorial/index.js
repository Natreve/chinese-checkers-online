            The objective of the game is to be the first player to move all of
            your 10 pieces accross the board into the opposite triangle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first player to occupy all 10 destitation triangle is the
            winner.

            Players can only move their pieces to an adjacent space or hop an
            adjacent piece to a empty space directly to the other side. You are
            allowed to chain together multiple hops
          </p>
          <p>
            You can only move your pieces within your destination triangle or
            your own triangle, you can also hop through other triangles so long
            has your piece doesnâ€™t land within it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once your piece is within your destination triangle you can only
            move it with in.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className={css.slide}>
          <p>
            If one or more of the destination holes contain a piece belonging to
            another player this does not prevent a player from winning.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game is simply won when all the available spots within the
            triangle are accupted with your pieces
