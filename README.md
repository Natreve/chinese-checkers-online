### What is Chinese Checkers [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_checkers)

Orignally called Sternhalma or Tiaoqi is a strategy board game of German origin which can be played by two, three, four, or six people, playing individually or with partners. The game is a modern and simplified variation of the game Halma.

The objective is to be first to race all of one's pieces across the hexagram-shaped board into "home"—the corner of the star opposite one's starting corner—using single-step moves or moves that jump over other pieces. The remaining players continue the game to establish second-, third-, fourth-, fifth-, and last-place finishers. The rules are simple, so even young children can play.

### Why I started the project

This project started as a personal challenge to create a online turn base strategy game like the classic GBA game advance wars, unfortunity I'm not that great at graphics design so I opted for something a little more simply and that's when the idea of create a online chinese checkers board game came to mind. Doing a bit of research I realised that their wasn't many options online.
